1. Executive Summary 
 Overview: 
Leap Quest is a simple 2D platformer game that is built using C++ and SFML to 
allow us to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts we learned in 
real time. The game allows a player to move and jump across platforms while 
applying physics like gravity and collision detection. 
 Key Findings: 
The project successfully implemented OOP features such as inheritance, 
encapsulation, and polymorphism, resulting in a better modular approach and 
had a good maintainable code structure. 
2. Introduction 
 Background: 
This project was been developed to  understand and demonstrate OOP concepts 
in real time. As Building a game provides a way to use classes, objects, and tell us 
how to build interactions between them. 
* Project Objectives: 
I. 
II. 
III. 
Develop a basic 2D game using SFML. 
Apply core OOP concepts. 
Learn modular software design. 
3. Project Description 
 Scope: 
Inclusions: 
Firstly there will be player character with movement and having jump 
ability. 
Also, Static platforms with collision detection 
Exclusions: 
I. 
II. 
No enemy AI or scoring system. 
No such sound effects or animations. 
 Technical Overview: 
Language: C++ 
Library: SFML 
IDE: Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 
OS: Windows 10 or above 
Platform: Windows 
4. Methodology 
 Approach: 
We plan to work in small iterative steps, testing each component as it's 
developed. Tasks are distributed according to each team member’s interest 
and strengths. 
 Roles and Responsibilities: 
Abdull mansoor : Game loop, rendering 
Bazil-Uddin-Khan: Player class and controls 
Daniyal : Platform classes and collision logic 
5. Project Implementation 
 Design and Structure: 
The code is organized into classes: Game, Player, Platform. Each handles a specific 
part of the logic. The main loop handles events, updates, and rendering. 
 Functionalities Developed: 
Character can move left/right and jump 
Platforms are solid and detect collision 
Simple gravity simulation 
 Challenges Faced: 
We initially struggled with accurate collision detection and managing game loop 
timing, but with time solved these through debugging techniques and adjusting 
SFML clock usage. 
6. Results 
* Project Outcomes: 
The objectives were met: we completed a working 2D platformer with structured 
OOP-based code and user interaction. 
 Screenshots and Illustrations: 
We will upload all screen shorts with our final submission to completely illustrate 
our code and process. 
 Testing and Validation: 
The game was tested on multiple inputs to ensure it has a  consistent behavior. 
We tested collision accuracy using all necessary debugging tools needed. 
7. Conclusion 
 Summary of Findings: 
Leap Quest program has  effectively combined all  theory concepts  and practice. 
It also helps to reinforce important OOP concepts through game development.  
Final Remarks: It has showed us the importance of doing  organized coding and 
doing iterative testing.
